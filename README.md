### Recent Personal Projects
1. Social Optim: A youtube algorithm optimization project (Typescript)
Due to my interest in the backend of social medias, I wanted to automatically improve youtube videos via data analysis.
I never got to the analysis part, but I automatically scraped data from youtube itself using a browser simulation.

2. Cosmetic Crafts Minecraft Plugin: Server mod for custom models with user customizibility. (Java, Maven)
I've had a long history developing minecraft and jumped back in briefly to create a small change.
This uses Maven and the Spigot API to let users attach certain attributes to items which when connected with user textures gives user-customizable models in-game.

3. Multiple Similar NestJS Backends
I've setup various full-stack projects while working on web development for the past few years and this primarily includes the following NestJS backends.
The most interesting part of this backend is the custom authentication system I use, which is a Single-Sign-On system that sends an email with a single use, time limited code to authenticate, with registration and logging in shared within the same feature.

4. Multiple Backends (Angular, NextJS)
Originally using NextJS, I created various front-ends for many projects, each one having different designs and a better understanding of the layout.
Since January 2023 I have begun using Angular after an internship.
